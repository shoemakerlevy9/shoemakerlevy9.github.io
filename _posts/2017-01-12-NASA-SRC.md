In October of 2017 NASA anounced the Space Robotics Competition (SRC). The goal of this competition was to have the robotics community compete to program Valkyrie (shown below) to perform maintanance tasks that may need to be done on Mars. The competition included a qualification round and a finals, both performed using the robot operating system (ROS) and the robotics simulator Gazebo.

I saw this competition on Reddit and immediatly someone created a post looking for teammates. That was how the r/obotics team formed. It included roughly 80 interested people. Of which 20 ended up officialy regestering with the team. We began work on the qualification tasks.

**Task 1**

Task 1 was to identify colered light on a panel and report the position in the robots head frame. No physical movement required.


**Task 2 **

Task 2 was to walk up to a door, press a button to open the door, and then walk through without falling over.


A maximum of 20 teams were allowed to make the finals. If 20 teams completed both tasks, then the teams with the fastest Task 2 times would be chosen.

This started oout hard. The code needed to run the simulation was a pain to install. If you did manage to get it installed and running, Valkyrie would often fall over.

But eventually we got the hang of things. Once we figured out the API that was given to us things where pretty simple. Here is an example bit of code for making Valkyrie walk.

    def walk_to_door():
	    # Walk to door
	    msg = FootstepDataListRosMessage()
	    msg.transfer_time = 0.5
	    msg.swing_time = 0.5
	    msg.execution_mode = 0
	    msg.unique_id = -1

	    msg.footstep_data_list.append(createFootStepOffset(RIGHT, [0.3, -0.1, 0.0]))
	    msg.footstep_data_list.append(createFootStepOffset(LEFT,  [0.7, -0.1, 0.0]))
	    msg.footstep_data_list.append(createFootStepOffset(RIGHT, [1.1, -0.1, 0.0]))
	    msg.footstep_data_list.append(createFootStepOffset(LEFT,  [1.5, -0.1, 0.0]))
	    msg.footstep_data_list.append(createFootStepOffset(RIGHT, [1.9, -0.1, 0.0]))
	    msg.footstep_data_list.append(createFootStepOffset(LEFT,  [2.3, -0.1, 0.0]))
	    msg.footstep_data_list.append(createFootStepOffset(RIGHT, [2.6, -0.1, 0.0]))
	    msg.footstep_data_list.append(createFootStepOffset(LEFT,  [2.9, -0.1, 0.0]))
	    msg.footstep_data_list.append(createFootStepOffset(RIGHT, [2.9, -0.1, 0.0])) # end at 2.9 (right before door)

	    footStepListPublisher.publish(msg)
	    rospy.loginfo('walk forward...')
	    waitForFootsteps(len(msg.footstep_data_list))


Our first successful run took over 50 seconds for Valkyrie to complete. By the end of the qualification round we had gotten that down to roughly 10.5 seconds. 

Unfortunetely this was not enough to put us in the top 20 teams. So our journey ended there.
